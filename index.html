					As a young girl, Annie spent many afternoons at her grandmother's house after school.  Her Nana, as she called her, had a finicky, white cat named Beau.  When they 
					would sit down to eat dinner, they would frequently find Beau waiting for a plate.  Her grandfather would often joke, "What do you think this is? Beau's Bistro?" 
					and Annie's restaurant's name was born.<br/>
					<br/>
					After being in business for over 15 years, Annie continues to enjoy providing all guests with delicious meals.  Whether they are on their way to work or about to begin 
					a night out on the town, Beau's Bistro offers a multitude of options hoping that everyone can find comfort in the food they enjoy here.
